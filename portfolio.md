Databases, Computer Architecture.

## <u>Projects</u>

**1.    Recommendation System for MovieLens Dataset**<br/>
	Created a recommendation system for 10 million movies of MovieLens dataset by implementing collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. Used nearest neighbor algorithm for the collaborative	  filtering method and alternating least squares method for matrix factorization.
	<u>Framework and platform used:</u> Apache Spark and Google Cloud Platform. You may find the [code here](https://github.com/bhparijat/Recommendation-system).
	
**2.    NYPD Crime Data Analysis**<br/>
	* Checking where it starts <br/>
**3.    Monte Carlo Tree Search For Atari Game Pong**<br/>
	Monte Carlo thing starts here<br/>
**4.    Exploration Map Inpainting**<br/>
	* This is the deep learning project<br/>
**5.    Lottery Scheduling**<br/>
	Implemented lottery scheduling to schedule processes in xv6 environment. Each process when created would be given a ticket. Whenever a process in the ready queue is to be scheduled, a random
	ticket is generated and tickets for the processess in the queue are summed up. As soon as the sum goes beyond the random number, a process is scheduled. <u>Framework and platform:</u> C, xv6,
	OSU server. Here is the [code link](https://github.com/bhparijat/Operating-Systems/tree/master/hw4) <br/> 
	
**6.    Parallel Reinforcement Learning** <br/>
	My teammate [Aashish](http://www.adhikariaashish.com.np/) and I,  implemented reinforcement learning algorithms like value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning, SARSA and Deep-Q-Network
	using [Ray library](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) to leverage computation power of multiple CPUs. The parallel implementation significantly improved the overall computation time for
	larger environments without affecting the resultant policy. All the implementation was done on Intel Dev Cloud. The code can be found
	[here](https://github.com/bhparijat/Parallel-Reinforcement-Learning).
	<br/>
**7. 	Gesture Recognition**
	Trained a deep neural network with softmax cross entropy loss and adam optimization for images containing hand gestures. The trained model attained an accuracy of over 91%.
	<u>Framework and platform:</u> Tensorflow and pelican cluster of Oregon State University. The jupyter notebook containing code can be found [here](https://github.com/bhparijat/gesture_recognition/blob/master/sign_recognition_using__DNN.ipynb). <br/>
**8. 	Apparel Classification**<br/>
	Trained a CNN model on Nvidia GPUs, to classify 10 types of apparel and other clothing wear. Used Adam optimizer and Cross Entropy loss for training and the trained model had a final loss of
	0.0035. [jupyter notebook link](https://github.com/bhparijat/Image-classification-Fashion-MNIST/blob/master/Fashion-MNIST.ipynb)<br/>

## <u>Graduate Research</u>

**Monte Carlo Planning** <br/>

My advisor, [Prof. Prasad Tadepalli](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/) and I, are working on developing an AI-player algorithm using Monte Carlo Tree Search for the game of [Klondike Solitaire](https://www.solitaire-klondike.com/).
