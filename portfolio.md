## <u>Course Work</u>


Data Structures, Algorithms, Calculus, Statistics theory, Statistical Methods, Probability,  Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Operating Systems,
Databases, Computer Architecture.

## <u>Projects</u>

**1.    Recommendation System for MovieLens Dataset**<br/>
	* Created a recommendation system for 10 million movies of MovieLens dataset by implementing collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.\
	* Used nearest neighbor algorithm for the collaborative filtering method and alternating least squares method for matrix factorization.
	* <u>Framework and platform used:</u> Apache Spark and Google Cloud Platform.
	* Code [link](https://github.com/bhparijat/Recommendation-system).
	
**2.    NYPD Crime Data Analysis**<br/>
	* Checking where it starts <br/>
**3.    Monte Carlo Tree Search For Atari Game Pong**<br/>
	Monte Carlo thing starts here<br/>
**4.    Exploration Map Inpainting**<br/>
	* This is the deep learning project<br/>
**5.    Lottery Scheduling**

**6.    Parallel Reinforcement Learning** <br/>
	My teammate [Aashish](http://www.adhikariaashish.com.np/) and I,  implemented reinforcement learning algorithms like value iteration, policy iteration, Q-learning, SARSA and Deep-Q-Network us	in	  g[Ray library](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) to leverage computation power of multiple CPUs. The parallel implementation significantly improved the overall computation time for larger envi	    ronments without affecting the resultant policy. All the implementation was done on Intel Dev Cloud. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/bhparijat/Parallel-Reinforcement-Learning).
	<br/>
**7. 	Gesture Recognition**

**8. 	Apparel Classification**<br/>
	Trained a CNN model on Nvidia GPUs, to classify 10 types of apparel and other clothing wear. Used Adam optimizer and Cross Entropy loss for training and the trained model had a final loss of 0.	  0035.

## <u>Graduate Research</u>

**Monte Carlo Planning** <br/>

My advisor, [Prof. Prasad Tadepalli](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/) and I, are working on developing an AI-player algorithm using Monte Carlo Tree Search for the game of [Klondike Solitaire](https://www.solitaire-klondike.com/).
